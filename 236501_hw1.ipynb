    "  *   H - Hole. When your agent reaches a hole, it falls into the water and cannot continue walking.\n",
    "  *   D - Dragon Ball. There are either two on the map. When the agent reaches a Dragon Ball, it is immediately collected. You can assume that they will not appear in a final or initial state.\n",
    "  *   F - This is the most common square on the map. The agent can walk on it safely.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Your agent can move faster by collecting 3 special objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "  *   T - [Talaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talaria). A pair of Winged Sandals that help you fly to the square.\n",

    "  *   L - Lightning. Makes you run faster to the square.\n",
